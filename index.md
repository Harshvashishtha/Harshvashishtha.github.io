## About me

  <p style="margin-left:220px;"> I am a postdoctoral associate in neuroscience in [Clark Lab](https://clarklab.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). I am interested in sensory neuroscience and currently working to understand how the visual information is processed inside the brain. I use fruit fly as a model organism to understand how neural circuitry works to interpret complex visual patterns in the natural world. I use psychophysical experiments and live 2-photon imaging to find answers to these problems. 
<p>
Prior to my current position, I completed my Ph.D. in physics at the University of Pittsburgh. During my doctoral studies, I explored the growth dynamics of bacteriumE. Coli and developed a specialized microfluidic device to study the inheritance patterns of physical cellular traits, such as cell size, across multiple generations of bacteria.
</p>
Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing cricket, reading about archaeological discoveries and attending live music concerts.
