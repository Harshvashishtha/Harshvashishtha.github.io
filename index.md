        <p >I am currently a postdoctoral associate in neuroscience in the research group of <a href="https://clarklab.yale.edu/">Dr. Damon Clark</a> at Yale University. My research focuses on understanding how neural circuitry works to interpret complex visual patterns in the natural world. I use fruit fly as a model organism and perform psychophysical experiments combined with live 2-photon imaging to find answers to these problems.</p>
        <p>Prior to my current position, I completed my Ph.D. in physics with <a href="https://salmanhanna.wixsite.com/salman-lab/">Dr. Hanna Salman</a> at the University of Pittsburgh. During my doctoral studies, I explored the growth dynamics of bacterium <em>E. Coli</em> and developed a specialized microfluidic device to study the inheritance patterns of physical cellular traits, such as cell size, across multiple generations of bacteria.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing cricket, reading about archaeological discoveries, and attending live music concerts.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Please feel free to explore my work and reach out via email if you'd like to connect or discuss further.</p>
