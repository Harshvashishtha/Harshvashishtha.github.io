## About me

<p style="margin-left:220px;"> I am a postdoctoral associate in neuroscience in <a href="https://clarklab.yale.edu/"> Clark Lab </a> at Yale University. I am interested in visual neuroscience and use fruit fly as a model organism to understand how neural circuitry works to interpret complex visual patterns in the natural world. I use psychophysical experiments and live 2-photon imaging to find answers to these problems.
  <p style="margin-left:220px;"> Prior to my current position, I completed my Ph.D. in physics at the University of Pittsburgh. During my doctoral studies, I explored the growth dynamics of bacteriumE. Coli and developed a specialized microfluidic device to study the inheritance patterns of physical cellular traits, such as cell size, across multiple generations of bacteria.

<p> Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing cricket, reading about archaeological discoveries and attending live music concerts. </p>
