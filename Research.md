## Multiple cue integration in visual perception
To determine the 3-D structure of the world from the 2-D images on our retinas, our brains make inferences. In natural settings, visual cues are usually noisy, and a single cue is usually not enough for animals to make a reliable decision. In such cases, brains tend to integrate evidence from multiple cues to make an inference.  My research aims to understand how and where multiple visual cues related to a single visual event are integrated to generate a coherent visual perception.

## Non genetic inheritence and phenotypic variability in _E. Coli_
Stochasticity in biochemical processes leads to variability in physical properties of isogenic cells over time. Although this heterogeneity helps cells survive changing environmental conditions, it is partially restrained by the inheritance of cellular components between consecutive generations. This raises the questions: over what time scale do cellular properties change? And how reliable and stable are the non-genetic inheritance mechanisms of cellular components? We answer these questions by measuring the non-genetic inheritance dynamics of cell properties of sister cells and determine their stability and persistence in the face of molecular noise and environmental fluctuations. This study showed that non-genetic inheritance influences cell properties over several generations, rather than the previously believed 1 or 2 generations. Finally, we corroborate our empirical findings  with a theoretical model that successfully reproduced multigenerational memory between sister cells.
